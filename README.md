# Kickstarter Data Analysis

### Libraries used

Pandas -
Numpy -
Matplotlib -
Seaborn -
Sklearn

### Motivation

1. What are the most successful Kickstarter project categories?

2. How does the size of Project's goal effect the success of a project?

3. What is the relationship between the size of a project and its amount of backers for both successful and unsuccessful projects?

4. Is it possible to build a model and successfully predict the likelihood of success for a project using this dataset?


### Process

Using the CRSIP-DM process to analyze a Dataset consisting of over 350,000 Kickstarter Projects from April 2009 to February 2018. Collected from Kaggle Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

Additional documentation of process and techniques used are noted in data-analysis.ipynb
